The analysis is divided into the following parts:

Genetic landscape and PRS transferibility between Africans and Europeans:
- Liability scale measurements
- Comparison of effect sizes between Africans and Europeans
- Generation of pseudo-control genotype from 1644 real controls of AA 
- PVE of IBD loci using effect sizes and allele frequencies of AA and EUR
- PRS of AA and UKB as a function of discovery ancestry group

Common Variant Analysis: 
- Include GWAS on WGS African American cohort using PLINK

Rare Variant Analysis:
R SKAT code for gene-level rare variant analysis
